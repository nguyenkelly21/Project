3) Open the folder and you will see 3 files called project1_starter.cpp, input.txt, and output.txt
4) Compile the project1_starter.cpp, input.txt, and output.txt file
5) In the input.txt, users can write their own sample text cases. The first line will take an array of the person1_busy_Schedule. The second line will also be an array of the person1_work_hours. The third line is the array of person2_busy_Schedule. The fourth line is the array of person2_work_hours. The last line will be the duration_of_meeting.
